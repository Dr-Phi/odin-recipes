Here i'm gonna put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far into practice.
French-Bread webpage :)
I'll use the Basic Structure of HTML;
following the good practices (as far as I know);
Using Headers to prioritize the content;
Using bold and italic bearing in mind the meaning of them;
Using lists, Pictures and Links!
